<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
10.0pt'>Lee developed a love for taking pictures as a child and naturally took
to the sea with her camera. She was already comfortable with the physical
challenge of being in the ocean; the creative challenge of photography came
later. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
10.0pt'>“The main reason I love ocean and surf photography is the combination
of the physical and creative challenge of it. It’s so cool, you’re floating and
you can get into any position or angle you want in the water. Where else can
you do that with photography?”</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
10.0pt'>I was curious to find out if Lee had any secret breath-holding
techniques. As it turns out, she took a free-diving class last summer to help
with her photography. While familiar with what to do when pulled under by a set
wave, “it was amazing to finally learn the mechanics and how your brain and
body work in the water.”</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
10.0pt'>In the training, Lee learned that when you feel what is called the
“urge to breathe,” it’s not that you’re out of oxygen but rather that you’re
feeling the buildup of carbon dioxide in your body. In essence, your body wants
air, but you still have more time. “When you get that urge to breathe, that’s
your halfway mark.” She explains that the way to push through the discomfort is
to distract your mind. “You will inevitably eat up oxygen by freaking out; it’s
[about asking] how can you calm your mind and your body.” Lee uses these
techniques to get her shot and, conversely, uses getting the shot to distract
her mind during a breath hold. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
10.0pt'>Lee herself has had some close calls in bigger surf. While
photographing in Fiji she had some freak waves come through and pull her under.
Her attitude in these situations is to try and stay relaxed. “Even if it seems
like eternity, I just kind of go with the flow. It will pass, and when it does
you’ll just come up to the surface.”</span></p>
